# JWT Algorithm Confusion Scanner

A specialized security tool for detecting JWT algorithm confusion vulnerabilities in web applications, allowing penetration testers to identify improper token validation techniques that can lead to authentication bypasses. **Features advanced verification and baseline comparison methods to minimize false positives.**

## Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are commonly used for authentication and session management. When improperly implemented, they can be vulnerable to various attacks, particularly "algorithm confusion" where attackers manipulate the algorithm field to bypass signature verification.

This tool systematically tests targets for multiple JWT attack vectors:

- "alg:none" attacks (acceptance of unsigned tokens)  
- Algorithm switching without re-validation
- Key confusion attacks (RS256 â†’ HS256 with public key)
- KID/JKU header parameter manipulation
- Payload tampering with signature bypass

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/geeknik/jwt-scanner.git
cd jwt-scanner

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- requests
- colorama
- urllib3

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
python jwt_scanner.py https://target.com
```

The scanner will attempt to extract JWT tokens from the response. If unsuccessful, you can provide the token manually:

```bash
python jwt_scanner.py https://target.com -t "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

### Advanced Usage with Verification

To reduce false positives, use the verification options:

```bash
python jwt_scanner.py https://target.com -t "eyJhbG..." --verify-endpoint "https://target.com/admin/dashboard" --success-strings "Welcome,admin panel" --failure-strings "unauthorized,login required"
```

This tells the scanner to:

1. Test the main URL for initial vulnerabilities
2. Verify successful exploitation by testing the vulnerable token against the `/admin/dashboard` endpoint
3. Look for specific strings that indicate success or failure

## Proof of Concept Generation

When the scanner identifies a vulnerability, it automatically generates proof of concept exploits:

1. **Token comparison** - Shows the original vs. forged token details
2. **Evidence** - Provides concrete differences between responses with legitimate vs. forged tokens
3. **Curl command** - Ready-to-use command to verify the vulnerability
4. **Python script** - Complete exploitation script for verification and demonstration

Example output:

## Attack Techniques

### Algorithm None Attack

Tests if the server accepts tokens with the `alg` value set to `none`, which eliminates signature verification.

### Key Confusion

Tests if the server is vulnerable to using the wrong key type for validation. For example, when a token signed with RSA is switched to HMAC and validated using the public key as the HMAC secret.

### Algorithm Substitution

Tests if the server accepts tokens where the algorithm has been changed without re-validating the signature.

### KID Manipulation

Tests if the Key ID (`kid`) parameter can be manipulated to point to files on the server's filesystem or to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.

### JKU Manipulation

Tests if the JWK Set URL (`jku`) parameter can be manipulated to point to an attacker-controlled location for key retrieval.

### Payload Manipulation

Tests if various privilege escalation payload modifications can be successful when combined with other attacks.

## Understanding Results and Avoiding False Positives

The scanner uses a sophisticated system to determine if a target is vulnerable to JWT attacks. However, it's important to understand how to interpret the results:

### Confidence Scores

Results include a confidence score (0-100%) that indicates how likely a vulnerability is real:

- **HIGH (70-100%)**: Strong evidence of vulnerability, especially if authentication verification is also high
- **MEDIUM (50-69%)**: Potential vulnerability that requires manual verification
- **LOW (0-49%)**: Likely not vulnerable or insufficient evidence

### Authentication Verification

The scanner now includes authentication verification that tests if JWT tokens actually affect access to resources:

- **High auth confidence (>0.5)**: Token appears to control access to protected resources
- **Low auth confidence (<0.1)**: Site may be ignoring JWT tokens entirely

### Warning Signs of False Positives

Be cautious of potential false positives when you see these warnings:

1. "Valid and invalid baseline responses are very similar" - Site may be ignoring tokens entirely
2. "Response very similar to previous attacks" - Different attack types shouldn't produce identical responses
3. "Token does not appear to affect access to resources" - Real JWT authentication should show differences

### Contextual Success Indicators

The scanner now uses contextual analysis for success indicators, only counting words like "success" or "profile" when they appear in authentication-related contexts, not just anywhere on the page.

### Verifying Results

For the most accurate results:

1. Always use the `--verify-endpoint` option with a protected resource
2. Provide custom `--success-strings` and `--failure-strings` specific to your target
3. Manually verify any "POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY" findings
4. Check the evidence in POC reports for clear differences between original and attack responses

## Creating Custom Payloads

You can create a JSON file with custom payloads to test:

```json
[
  {
    "header": {
      "alg": "HS256",
      "typ": "JWT", 
      "kid": "../../etc/passwd"
    },
    "payload": {
      "sub": "1234567890",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "admin": true
    },
    "key": "your-test-key"
  }
]
```

## Security Considerations

This tool is designed for security professionals with proper authorization to test applications. Unauthorized testing may violate laws and terms of service. Always:

1. Obtain written permission before testing
2. Respect rate limits and implement appropriate delays
3. Report findings responsibly to the affected organizations

## Reducing False Positives

The scanner uses several advanced techniques to minimize false positives:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Establishes how the application responds to valid and invalid tokens for comparison, with detection of sites that ignore tokens entirely
2. **Authentication Verification**: Tests if tokens actually affect access to protected resources by comparing responses with and without tokens
3. **Contextual Success Indicators**: Only counts success indicators when they appear in authentication-related contexts, not just anywhere on the page
4. **Cross-Attack Response Comparison**: Detects when different attack types produce very similar responses, suggesting the site ignores tokens
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates a confidence percentage based on multiple indicators, with adjustments based on authentication verification
6. **Secondary Verification**: Tests verified tokens against additional endpoints to confirm exploitation
7. **Response Analysis**: Examines response content, headers, and status codes for both positive and negative indicators
8. **Custom Success/Failure Indicators**: Allows specifying application-specific strings that indicate successful/failed exploitation
